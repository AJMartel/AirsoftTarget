# Airsoft Target System - by Manuel Palmeira @ EAS

Public code for a simple, smart, airsoft target system. Feel free to use and change this code/project.
**_Just don't use it to exploit others!_**

This system uses piezos and RGY LEDs. For more information on this project and the circuit please check out the
instructibles page (soon to be added).

Since I just need simple colors (the 3 primary ones with the LED), I've coded the colors in a ON/OFF base.
If you want to have more color variations make sure to connect the LEDs to PWM pins and change the values on the
color functions according to the color that you want.

I based the code on the Arduino Knock Sensor. Sources of inspiration:
- https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-3-rgb-leds/overview
- https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/KnockSensor

What's left on the project:
- [x] Write and upload the source code (currently v1.0)
- [ ] Design and print circuit board
- [ ] Build the actual targets
- [ ] Install and calibrate system
- [ ] Write and publish instructables page
